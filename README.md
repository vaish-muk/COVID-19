1- Covid-19 Visualization and Prediction 
An analysis and prediction on available data on the novel corona virus
# Steps to Understand it more clearly!!
Import the data (make sure you update this on a daily basis)
Get all the dates for the outbreak
Convert integer into datetime for better visualization
Model for predicting # of confirmed cases. I am using support vector machine, bayesian ridge , and linear regression
Graphing the number of confirmed cases, active cases, deaths, recoveries, mortality rate, and recovery rate
At last it prints total number of confirmed cases in every particular country (last updated March 24)
