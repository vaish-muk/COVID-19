An analysis and prediction on available data on the novel corona virus
# Steps to Understand it more clearly!!  
a- Import the data (make sure you update this on a daily basis)  
b- Get all the dates for the outbreak  
c- Convert integer into datetime for better visualization  
d- Model for predicting # of confirmed cases. I am using support vector machine, bayesian ridge , and linear regression  
e- Graphing the number of confirmed cases, active cases, deaths, recoveries, mortality rate, and recovery rate  
f- At last it prints total number of confirmed cases in every particular country (last updated March 24)
